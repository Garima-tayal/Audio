**How to Run**
----------------

### Setup

1. Install Python and the required libraries (PyPDF2, pyttsx3, and pdfminer.six) using pip:
```
pip install PyPDF2 pyttsx3 pdfminer.six
```
2. Place the PDF files you want to convert in the `data/pdf` folder.

### Environment

* Python 3.9 or later
* PyPDF2 1.26.0 or later
* pyttsx3 2.71 or later
* pdfminer.six 20181108 or later

### Build

```
python Audio.py
```
2. The script will convert the PDF files in the `data/pdf` folder to audio files and save them in the same folder.

### Deploy

1. Deploy the script to a server or a cloud platform (e.g., AWS Lambda).
2. Schedule the script to run periodically using a scheduler (e.g., cron jobs).

**Testing Instructions**
-------------------------
